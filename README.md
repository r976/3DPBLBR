3DPBLBR stands for "3D Printable, Bird-Leg, Bipedal Robot". It was designed with the goal of providing makers, hobbyists, and researchers with a developed robot platform to explore their ideas. 

The robot is designed to be printed out of PETG and use 12MM OD/10MM ID carbon fiber tubes, 608 bearings, MG996R; DS3218; DS3320 hobby servos, and an Arduino Due. The backward jointed leg, akin to bird-leg anatomy, was selected due to the possibility of adding LiDAR and Camera sensors to the robot to allow for autonomous navigation. By positioning the knee-joint backwards, it allows for frontal space to be cleared up, leading to an un-obstructed view for any navigation sensors. 3DPBLBR also incorporates a BNO085x Interntial Measurement Unit (IMU) to relay information about the robot's position to the Arduino, allowing the robot to keep its balance over uneven terrain or from disturbances. From waiting tables and transporting goods to land surveying and participating in search-and-rescue operations, 3DPBLBR has limitless capabilites.  

3DPBLBR is currently a work in progress, however, a prototype has been built. It can be seen in the YouTube video. 3DPBLBR will likely be undergoing some major revisions in order to improve its capability and functionallity.
